Buynomics is helping a client to understand the effect of their prices, and as part of a new software solution, you are 
researching options to solve this in a data-science-driven manner. 



The client has given us their data, essentially: 

1. product data, containing the products they want to analyse

2. sales data, the sales data of the products


The question basically asks for two things:

1. Familiarise yourself with your data, ideally with some descriptive plots and statistics. 

2. Develop a simple model predicting units from prices (e.g. using elasticities) for all products, 

so a model describing the distribution (or a point estimate) of units | price, product attributes. 

Fit the model to the data and provide some estimate of the risk of your model against a baseline.
